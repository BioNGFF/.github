## BioNGFF says ðŸ‘‹

BioNGFF is a consortium of universities, research labs producing open-source software and format standards to support OME-Zarr.
The work is supported by Wellcome Trust Technology Development grants.
We currently focus on building a [Web Viewer](https://github.com/BioNGFF/biongff-viewer) to support multi-modal imaging data available as OME-Zarr and tools to import public OME-Zarr datasets into [OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/), a well-established data management platform.
