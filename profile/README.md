## BioNGFF says ðŸ‘‹

BioNGFF is a consortium of universities, research labs producing open-source software and format standards to support OME-Zarr.
The [Next Generation Data Formats For 21st Century Biology](https://wellcome.org/research-funding/funding-portfolio/funded-grants/next-generation-data-formats-21st-century-biology) project is supported by Wellcome Trust Technology Development grants.
We currently focus on building a [Web Viewer](https://github.com/BioNGFF/biongff-viewer) to support multi-modal imaging data available as OME-Zarr and tools to import public OME-Zarr datasets into [OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/), a well-established data management platform.
